# Popular Movies Stage 2 (Room)

## Project Overview
Welcome back to Popular Movies! In this second and final stage, you’ll add additional functionality to the app you built in Stage 1.

You’ll add more information to your movie details view:

- You’ll allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
- You’ll allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
- You’ll also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star).
- You'll create a database to store the names and ids of the user's favorite movies (and optionally, the rest of the information needed to display their favorites collection while offline).
- You’ll modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.

## Implementation Guide
Just like in Stage 1, we've come up with a set of milestones that will help structure your development and ensure that you reach the final product smoothly. These milestones are listed in the Stage 2 [Implementation Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZlN1fUsCSKuInLECcJkslIqvpKlP7jWL2TP9m6UiA6I/pub?embedded=true#h.7sxo8jefdfll).
